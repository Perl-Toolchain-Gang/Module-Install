- "use warnings" everywhere
- no LICENSE (see proposed changes in other dists for how to add one -- or MI's own license provider plugin, assuming there is one)
- missing dependency on CPANPLUS?

- no need to 'use vars', since we require perl 5.6 -- but be careful that the
  difference between vars and 'our' isn't important somewhere.


weird test results:

modules such as Module::Install::Base::FakeAdmin shouldn't be in the index.
mark their package declarations as # hide from PAUSE -- but search
grep.cpan.me first just in case something breaks


- create Test::DistManifest test to verify stuff... and a makefile.pl thingy to add xt/ to tests if -e .git
