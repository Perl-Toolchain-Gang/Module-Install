=head1 DESCRIPTION

One of the primary design goals of L<Module::Install> is to simplify
the creation of F<Makefile.PL> scripts.

Part of this involves the gradual reduction of any and all superfluous
characters, with the ultimate goal of requiring no non-critical
information in the file.

L<Module::Install::DSL> is a simple B<Domain Specific Language> based
on the already-lightweight L<Module::Install> command syntax.

The DSL takes one command on each line, and then wraps the command
(and its parameters) with the normal quotes and semi-colons etc to
turn it into Perl code.

=head1 SUPPORT

Bugs should be reported via the CPAN bug tracker at
